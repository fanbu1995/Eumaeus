Our set of positive and negative controls is constructed by first selecting four exposures and four outcomes, and generating controls for each of these. We can therefore stratify our controls accordingly. For example, there are 100 controls with acute pancreatitis as the outcome, and we can evaluate how well each method performs on this subset of controls.
