This study was be conducted in four observational health databases:

<h2>CCAE</h2>
The IBM MarketScan&#8482; Commercial Database (CCAE) database represents data from 138 million individuals enrolled in United States employer-sponsored insurance health plans from January 2000 until March 2018. The data includes adjudicated health insurance claims (e.g. inpatient, outpatient, and outpatient pharmacy) as well as enrollment data from large employers and health plans who provide private healthcare coverage to employees, their spouses, and dependents. Additionally, it captures laboratory tests for a subset of the covered lives. This administrative claims-database includes a variety of fee-for-service, preferred provider organizations, and capitated health plans. The major data elements contained within this database are outpatient pharmacy dispensing claims (coded with National Drug Codes), and inpatient and outpatient medical claims, which provide procedure codes (coded in CPT-4, HCPCs, ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-PCS) and diagnosis codes (coded in ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM). The data also contain selected laboratory test results (those sent to a contracted thirds-party laboratory service provider) for a non-random sample of the population (coded with LOINC codes). 
<h2>JMDC</h2>
Japan Medical Data Center (JDMC) database consists of data from 60 society-managed health insurance plans covering workers aged 18 to 65 and their dependents (children younger than 18 years old and elderly people older than 65 years old). JMDC data includes membership status of the insured people and claims data provided by insurers under contract (e.g. patient-level demographic information, inpatient and outpatient data inclusive of diagnosis and procedures, and prescriptions as dispensed claims information). Claims data are derived from monthly claims issued by clinics, hospitals and community pharmacies. For claims only the month and year are provided; however, prescriptions, procedures, admission, discharge, and start of medical care are associated with a full date. The data covers 5 million subjects from January 2005 to December 2017. 
<h2>MDCR</h2>
IBM MarketScan&#8482; Medicare Supplemental Database (MDCR) represents health services of retirees in the United States with primary or Medicare supplemental coverage through privately insured fee-for-service, point-of-service, or capitated health plans. These data include adjudicated health insurance claims (e.g. inpatient, outpatient, and outpatient pharmacy). Additionally, it captures laboratory tests for a subset of the covered lives. The data cover 10 million subjects from January 2000 to April 2018.
<h2>PanTher</h2>
The Optum&#8482; Pan-Therapeutic (PanTher) Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset contains medical record data of 86 million subjects primarily from United States Integrated Delivery Networks. These include clinical information, inclusive of prescriptions as prescribed and administered, lab results, vital signs, body measurements, diagnoses, procedures, and information derived from clinical notes using Natural Language Processing (NLP). PanTher integrates provider data from different EHR platforms (i.e. Cerner, Epic, GE, McKesson, etc.) and different versions of the same EHR platform. The data spans January 2006 to December 2017.
